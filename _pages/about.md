I am an aspiring data scientist! I started learning about data science in March 2019, and built this website to showcase my personal projects. 

When I'm not spending my free time learning new data science skills, I enjoy photographing & spending time in nature, rock climbing, crocheting, knitting, and puzzles. All of the photos on this site were taken by me!
