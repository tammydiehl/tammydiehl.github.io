Using plotly in python, I've created a visualization of the acreage & biodiversity of all U.S. national parks.

I pulled the data from the Kaggle website. It came as two separate datasets - one containing all park codes and location data, and the other containing information on species observed in each park. 

Thankfully, this data was thoughtfully curated, so limited data cleansing was needed. Here is a snapshot of these dataframes.

Parks: 
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ sit.baseurl }}/images/parks.jpg" alt="parks dataframe">
Species:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ sit.baseurl }}/images/species.jpg" alt="parks dataframe">

I calcualted the species biodiversity using the pandas' "nunique" method on the species ID column. 

```python
diversity_by_park = species_df.groupby('Park Code')['Species ID'].nunique()
````
And once everything was in order, used pandas to merge these datasets into one dataframe. 

```python
merged_df = pd.merge(left=df,right=diversity_by_park_df, left_on='Park Code', right_on='Park Code')
```
After merging the data, I implemented a go.Scattergeo object from the Plotly graphing library to create the interactive visual below, mapping each National Park to it's corresponding latitude & longitude.
Here it is!
