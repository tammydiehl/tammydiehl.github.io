Using plotly in python, I've created a visualization of the acreage & biodiversity of all U.S. national parks.

I pulled the data from the Kaggle website. It came as two separate datasets - one containing all park codes and location data, and the other containing information on species observed in each park. 

Thankfully, this data was thoughtfully curated, so limited data cleansing was needed. And once everything was in order, used pandas to merge these datasets into one dataframe. 

```python
merged_df = pd.merge(left=df,right=diversity_by_park_df, left_on='Park Code', right_on='Park Code')
```
